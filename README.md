General practice on smart contract interactions;
Storage_factory as the main file interacting with the simplestorage.sol

We import storage factory and instantiate it, solidity identifies it as a contract type;
Create an array for simple contracts, like previously learnt in case of structs

The function is said to make create a new instance of the simple storage contract
Then, store it in the created array.

using the array index to access it, we can likewise track our simple storage contract content;
and input variables

Lastly, we create a getter function that allows to read modifications on the contract and identify them
